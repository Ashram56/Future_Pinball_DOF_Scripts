# Future_Pinball_DOF_Scripts
Contains Future Pinball DOF scripts

This repository will contain Future Pinball updated table scripts for DOF support.

Baseline of work will be publicly released Future Pinball tables

Script code is extracted from Future Pinball tables through the editor, and can be injected back the same way (until we find an alternate easier path for integration)

First table to be implemented: Indiana Jones Ultimate Pro 1.03 from SLAM1LT

Master branch contains the original script from SLAM1LT
v0.1 branch contains first DOF modifications

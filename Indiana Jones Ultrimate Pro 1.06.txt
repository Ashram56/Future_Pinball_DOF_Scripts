' -----------------

' Complete all 16 (or 20) scenes to start.  Frankly, if you made it this far....you CHEATED DR JONES!

' Might not need one, the game is very challenging and fully packed already.  A lot of work for something less than 1% of players will ever see.
' Get the Bonus Ball instead, it's pretty much the same idea I had for the Wizard Mode anyway.

' Raiders = 5 Ark Shots
' Temple = 5 Shankara Stone Shots
' Crusade = 5 Holy Grail Shots
' Kingdom = 5 Crystal Skull Shots

' Each shot is worth 125k. Complete a full set from any movie for an additional 350k. Complete any 2 sets for
' an Extra Ball and return to the main game (or free game if it was a real machine).

' Complete all 4 movies and you truley are a Pinball Wizard and will be showered in gold.  Impossible, I only you
' 36 seconds (length of the music track) so grab what you can, kinda like a supermarket sweep.

' The player is awarded a movie item as a reward for successfully completing a scene.

' These are perks which will effect certain rules for the remainder of the game.

' The Perks:

' - BALL SAVER increases by 1 second each time it is activated.
' - Player can have 2 EXTRA BALLS per ball rather than the normal 1.
' - Any COMBO will also increase the score value for that shot each time.
' - The SUPER POPS timer is extended.
' - Bonus is held for any ball that drains SDTM.
' - Bonus Muliplier always starts at 2.
' - INDY and JONES scoring values are doubled.
' - Both SUPER SPINNERS are lit at the start of the next ball.
' - A complete orbit shot will increase the SPINNER value each time.
' - The Map Room Multiplier will increase by 4 instead of 2.
' - Double Scoring timer is extended.
' - Super Spinner will also increase Movie Jackpots.
' - A ricochet shot from any INDY target to the GRAIL SCOOP will automatically start the next scene.
' - If any ball drains within 30 secs, the next ball will have an extended BALL SAVER.
' - Hitting any INDY or JONES target 5 times during INDY JONES Scoring will award an EXTRA BALL.
' - Successfully hitting the Cairo Swordsman within 10 seconds awards the highest Movie Jackpot value.

' for now (ver 1.03) items are not remembered for each player...

' ** AT NO TIME SHOULD THE LCD BE PLAYING CLIPS CONTINUOUSLY OR FOR LONG PERIODS ** 

' This is very important. I hate what Jersey Jack and Stern are doing with their LCDs when it comes to playing movie
' clips.  It kills the atmosphere, the tension, the excitement and ultimately the gameplay.

' Imagine the movie Jaws with added scenes showing more shark!  Less is always more, the masters of cinema taught me that.

' Short and rare clips are like mini rewards for the player - they make the shot, they get a cool clip to watch.
' Having a game saturated with movie clips and fancy animations is a TERRIBLE idea.  Looks amazing to a spectator,
' but I don't give 2 shits about spectators, I only care about offering the player the best possible experience.

' And this is JJ and Stern's mistake.  People are gathering round to watch a TV screen!  Not the action on the
' playfield.

 

' The system I use to play clips uses individual image files that move very quickly creating a clip.
' Future Pinball only allows 1000 image files for each library which is a tremenous pain in my arse, so
' I have to use 3 overlays at the same time, each one on top of the other.  How I manage these overlays
' can be complicated as I have to instantly disable 1 overlay to play the other.

' The audio for each clip is also captured seperatly and in most cases edited, so it's not always as it was
' in the movie.  I have to edit out unwanted music in the background, shorten dialogue or add more 'ooompth'
' to sound effects.  Both clip and audio are then matched perfectly to play in sync.

' It is tempting to always add more clips, but too many takes too much away from the action on the playfield,
' which is the highest priority.  Remember: Pinball is 95% what happens on the playfield and only 5% what you see
' on any display....unless you're Jersey Jack, then it's 50/50.
